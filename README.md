# Project Title
This project presents a solution to a task from the subject "Programming Languages", which aims to develop programming skills in different languages.
In the submitted project, I performed the task in the Haskell language.
The content of the task:
For a given natural number n, give a natural number m for which the number of possible solutions of the
of the equation 1/a + 1/b = 1/m (where a and b are natural numbers) is greater than or equal to n.
For example, for n = 3 it will be m = 4 because there are exactly three solutions to this equation:
a1 = 5 and b1 = 20, a2 = 6 and b2 = 12, a3 = 8 and b3 = 8 ie: 1/5+1/20 = 1/4, 1/6+1/18 = 1/4 i 1/8+1/8 = 1/4.
